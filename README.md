# Note

1. Everything will be shared via Github.

1. We will try to make the sessions interactive with a lot of labs/demos as we progress. Initially we will setup the foundation.

1. It is assumed that all the actions are performed in the North Virginia Region (us-east-1). For any other Region, the appropriate changes have to be made in the code.

1. AWS is making constant changes to the UI and rolling them slowly to users. The images in the documentation might not reflect the actual screen. But, the overall procedure is all the same.

1. All the resources which have been created during the session would be deleted towards the end of the session. All the resources have to be created again on a daily basis.
